# It has been suggested that the use of cellphobes should be limted in schools,
altought it seems a bit harsh but i strongly agree but this suggestion.

Firsly, the use of cellhphones in schools can and is causing harm to students,
not in phisical way, but in school performance way, for example, students can use
cellphones during an exam which will get their exams taken away in result of that use.
furthermore cellphones can be also used during classes and therefor result in students being 
distracted and thus get their school performance oon the low.

Secondly, the use of cellphones can be used in a way in which the use breachs privacy laws,
to illustrate, imagine if a student films a bunch of other students without their consent,
therefor the students to report him which will reuslt in him getting in a big trouble.

To wrap it up, the use of cellphones by students in school can be extremely destructive
and so, the suggestion of limting that use is in my opinion blessed.
